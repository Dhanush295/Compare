(F) during such five Business Day period, if requested by Parent, the Company engages in good faith negotiations with Parent to amend this Agreement in such a manner that the offer that was determined to constitute a Superior Proposal no longer constitutes a Superior Proposal;

(B) at least five Business Days prior to any meeting of the Company Board at which the Company Board will consider and determine whether such Intervening Event requires the Company Board to effect, or cause the Company to effect, a Company Change in Recommendation, the Company provides Parent with a written notice specifying the date and time of such meeting and the reasons for holding such meeting; (C) during such five Business Day period, if requested by Parent, the Company engages in good-faith negotiations with Parent to amend this Agreement in a manner that obviates the need for the Company Board to effect, or cause the Company to effect, a Change in Recommendation as a result of such Intervening Event; and (D) the Company Board determines in good faith, after obtaining and taking into account the advice of outside legal counsel, that, in light of such Intervening Event, a Change in Recommendation is required in order for the Company Board to comply with its fiduciary obligations to the Company\u2019s stockholders under applicable Legal Requirements.",
